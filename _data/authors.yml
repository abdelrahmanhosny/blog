    Hello! My name is Abdelrahman and I am a research-oriented software engineer. 
    Currently, I study towards a PhD in Computer Science at Brown University, where I try to learn everything that gets me
    closer to my goal - _to establish an AI-based datacenter in Africa_. This blog navigates a variety of topics
    that Iâ€™ve come across in my journey as a student. Although most of the writing is to confirm that I understand something,
    I hope that it would help someone out there in their job.
